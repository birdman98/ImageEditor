# Image Editor

Simple GUI program made in C# with WPF and .NET framework, which focuses on image processing. You can edit your image with a bunch of available effecs from menu, e.g. gaussian blur, color, invert colors, make sepia, make grayscale, gamma filtering, cropping, changing contrast and much more. 

This program is my project for Computer Programming at studies.
